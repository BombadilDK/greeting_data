# README Greeting



### Purpose

Purely for educational use. It's a BashScript, .sh, that reads a .json file and say hello. A bit like 'Hello world'. It should have all the trappings, documentation and so on. This is important, so if you feel it's lacking please say so.

I do use AI: Microsoft Copilot, Gemini and GitHub Copilot

But only to the extent as tutors. They do not make this script. In fact any of them would have made this in a minute or so, whereas I will be several days making this.



### Structure

greeting.sh
├── check_file_exists()
├── count_people()
├── ask_how_many_to_greet()
├── greet_people()
└── main()

It's meant to be like a program in its build, so it will be made up by functions which each has its, yes well, function :-)

It will give some feedback to the user, it will also have some check of the data, the .json file, and it will include a tiny bit of user interaction. Not much of any of it but a bit to say it is covered.
